          The Mega Drive, known as the Genesis in North America, is a 16-bit
          home video game console developed and sold by Sega. The Mega Drive was
          Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mega Drive supports two add-ons that each support their own game
          libraries. The first is the Mega-CD (known as the Sega CD in North
          America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play it's library
          of games in CD-ROM format. The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit
          peripheral which uses ROM cartidges and serves as a pass-through for
          Mega Drive games. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mega Drive has often ranked among the best video games consoles.
          In 2009, IGN named it the fifth best video game console, citing its
          edge in sports games and better home version of Mortal Kombat, and
          lauding "what some consider to be the greatest controller ever
          created: the six button".
